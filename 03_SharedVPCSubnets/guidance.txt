To share subnet(s) within an organization, do the following:

1) Enable resource sharing from the Organizations console
2) In Resource Access Manager -> Settings, enable resource sharing (yes this feels redundant)
3) Create a share that includes subnets - no need to include Principals
4) Switch accounts and launch an EC2 instance into one of the shared vpc subnets
