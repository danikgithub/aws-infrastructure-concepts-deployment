#This demo is done entirely in the console but I still have some recommendations:

#Change the engine type and version to see how you lose a LOT of Aurora features.  If you aren't running MySQL and the single recommended version, you cannot take advantage of all Aurora has to offer.

#Features you lose by changing version:
#Serverless
#Multi-master
#and others
